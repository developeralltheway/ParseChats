# ParseChats
This project will be used to build a parser to parse chat messages written in English language for non-english language.

Country like India people use English words frequently when then converse. This prompts them to write words from Indian language even using English alphabets. 
This creates a problem for the language parsers used to parse these chat messages as they cannot match the words in the standatd English dictionary

This is a righ source of information, if companies mine these texts/messages then they will better understand the consumer demands much better, as two friends more
often than not will converse in their native language. They will exchange views and opinions in their native language.They use English alphabets during the conversation. 
for example : Ami kaal akta Chinese resturant e kheye chilam, bhalo chilo na. Khub bhir chilo kintu khabar ta taratari enechilo. / I had food in a Chinese Resturant yesterday, the resturant was not good. 
It was very crowded but still they managed to bring the order quickly.
In the above conversation one of the person is narrating his/her experience with the Resturant. The issue is words like Ami/I kaal/yesterday is not available in dictionaries as the dilect is embedded in these words, 
for example kaal/kal sounds similar phonetically. Hence these variations are huge. Similar is the case with other Indian Languages.    

I am creating this project ia an attempt to solve this problem.
